# Florensia-File-Viewer
Florensia-File-Viewer allows to view decoded data (and all other data) in the Florensia client. You can then export the data to JSON or Excel.

## Using
When opening the compiled executable, you will be asked to select a folder. This folder can be anywhere, but since you want to view the client, selecting the root folder (root folder contains \bin and \data)  should yield the best results.

## .pak Files
Florensia stores most of its data in .pak files. The treeview will allow you to open them just like normal folders. When double clicking on them, they will expand.

> By default, .pak files are not 'loaded' because this would add overhead to the start time. The content list will only be loaded when double clicking on them.
